# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## "hello, world!"

This is the first application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). Hello, world!


## What we learned in this chapter
- Ruby on Rails is a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language.
- Installing Rails, generating an application, and editing the resulting files is easy using a pre-configured cloud environment.
- Rails comes with a command-line command called `rails` that can generate new applications `rails new` and run local 
servers `rails server`.
- We added a controller action and modified the root route to create a “hello, world” application.
- We protected against data loss while enabling collaboration by placing our application source code under version 
control with Git and pushing the resulting code to a private repository at Bitbucket.
- We deployed our application to a production environment using Heroku.
